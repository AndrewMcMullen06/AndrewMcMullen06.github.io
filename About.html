<!--Brief history of the restaurant including a link to an external site-->
<p id="history">We are a dedicated and outgoing team providing the local area with our best hospitality. Built in the 70's, the pub was built and managed by David Taylor whilst also running the Royal Hotel in Colwyn Bay. Built by the bricks of demolished houses through Old Colwyn during the construction of the A55 by David Taylor (originally called Taylor's pub). The property exchanged hands in 1983 to Ray Perry and was bought by the current company in 1998. The state of redecoration was indeed a triumph. If interested we would highly recommend reading more on the history on our official site <a href="https://www.brunningandprice.co.uk/penybryn/history/">over here</a>.
